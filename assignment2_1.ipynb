    "### A Stack Abstratct Data Type \n",
    "is where elements are 'stacked' on top of each other one after the other. A key feature of this is that only the most recent addition to the stack (the element at the top of the stack) can be removed or accessed(popped), similarly a new element can only be inserted to the top of the stack (pushed). This can be implemented using a linked list similar to the one in part 1 but with slightly different funcionality or using an array. The Stack ADT operates a last in first out system for adding / removing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has two primary operations that is pop(), to remove an element from the top of  the stack and return it, and push()add an element to the top of the stack. Other support operations include; top() which shows the top element in the stack without removing it, size() which returns the number of elements in the stack, and is_empty() which returns a boolean indicating if the stack is empty or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two life examples of a stack would be a pile of plates and a deck of cards, you can place the top plate ot card down or remove it, but you cannot remove the plates / cards below the top card.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Queue Abstract Data Type\n",
    "is different from a Stack in that it operates a first in first out system, that is the element that has been in the queue the longest must be removed first. Elements are added to the rear or 'back' of the queue (enqueued) and removed from the front of the queue (dequeued). An item that has been added will have to wait for all other items added before it to be dequeued before it can be dequeued.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has similar operations to the Stack but slightly different. Enqueue() adds and element to the back of the queue, and dequeue() removes an element from the front of the queue and returns it. It has support operations size() which returns the nummber of elements in the queue, is_empty() which returns a boolean indicating if the queue is empty or not, and show_front() which returns but does not remove the element in the queue which is at the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two real life examples of a queue would be queues of people at the supermarket, the person at the front of the queue is the person who got there first, and anyone joining the queue will enter at the rear and wait for all people already in the queue to leave. Another example of a queue could be a FIFO pipe in bash programming, the first variables sent through the pipe is the first variable out of the pipe at the other end.\n",
